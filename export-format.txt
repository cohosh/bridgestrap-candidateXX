The current (v1) metrics format is available by default at /metrics/v1.
It includes only bridge lines for now, but may someday also include more.

It's a line-oriented format as used elsewhere in the Tor ecosystem.  Elements
of each line are separated with whitespace.  The first element of the line
denotes what kind of line it is; remaining elements are in a KEY=VAL format.
The VAL may be quoted; if so it may contain spaces and should be interpreted
as if it were a Go string.

Implementations reading this format SHOULD ignore any lines whose first (tag)
element they don't recognize, and SHOULD ignore any KEY within a line that
they do not recognize.

The KEYs on a line may appear in any order.  The same key can appear more
than once.

Currently exposed lines are:

     "bridge"
          "at="YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS
          "cache-hits="N
          "err="QuotedError
          "id="Identifier

       Describes a cached bridge test result.  The Identifier is a
       hex-encoded SHA256 hash of the bridge's fingerprint, or a set of "0"
       characters (if no fingerprint was given).  The "at" time is the time
       when the test was completed, in UTC.  The QuotedError is a quoted
       string representing the outcome of the test.  The "cache-hits" value
       is the number of times the bridge's result has been requested from the
       cache.
